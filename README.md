Generate system prompts for LLM applications:

<div>
    <img style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%;" width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4269e105-f190-45b6-aa73-abaf7e267c8d" />
</div>

## How Does It Work?
When a system prompt is requested:
- Evaluates the user's input and identifies the key themes and topics.
- Generates each section of the system prompt.
- Each section is reviewed to ensure it aligns with the desired structure and content.
- Presents the combined output. Provides the option to download the prompt in Markdown format.
- Options to regenerate sections, or the entire prompt.
- Follows the best practices [provided by OpenAI](https://cookbook.openai.com/related_resources#papers-on-advanced-prompting-to-improve-reasoning)
